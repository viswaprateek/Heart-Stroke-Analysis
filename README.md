# Heart Stroke Analysis Project

## Overview
This project analyzes factors contributing to heart stroke prediction using Power BI. The dataset includes a variety of medical and demographic features. The objective is to identify key indicators of heart disease, using visualizations and analytics to gain insights into the relationship between these factors and heart stroke risk.

## Features
The dataset includes the following features:

- **Age**: Patient's age.
- **BP (Blood Pressure)**: Blood pressure level.
- **Chest Pain Type**: Type of chest pain experienced (e.g., typical angina, atypical angina).
- **Cholesterol**: Cholesterol levels.
- **EKG Results**: Electrocardiogram results.
- **Exercise Angina**: Presence of exercise-induced angina.
- **FBS Over 120**: Fasting blood sugar over 120 mg/dL.
- **Heart Disease**: Whether the patient has heart disease (0 = No, 1 = Yes).
- **Max HR**: Maximum heart rate achieved.
- **Number of Vessels Fluro**: Number of major vessels (0-3) colored by fluoroscopy.
- **Sex**: Gender of the patient (1 = Male, 0 = Female).
- **Slope of ST**: The slope of the peak exercise ST segment.
- **ST Depression**: ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest.
- **Thallium**: Results from a thallium stress test.

## Tools Used
- **Power BI**: Used for data visualization and analysis.
- **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)**: For creating calculated columns and measures.
- **Data Cleaning**: Performed within Power BI using Power Query.


## Key Findings
- **Age** and **Cholesterol** levels show a significant correlation with the presence of heart disease.
- **Exercise Angina** and **ST Depression** are strong indicators of potential heart disease risk.
- The **Number of Vessels Fluro** and **Thallium Test** results further strengthen predictions.
